## FAQ
**Q: Which is better - native or cross-platform?**
A: It depends on your requirements. Native offers better performance and access to all device features, while cross-platform is more cost-effective for reaching both platforms with a single codebase. We recommend the best approach based on your budget, timeline, and feature requirements.

**Q: Do you publish apps to stores?**
A: Yes, we handle the complete process including App Store and Google Play Store publication. We ensure compliance with all guidelines, prepare necessary assets, and manage the submission process.

**Q: How do you ensure app performance?**
A: We optimize for performance by following best practices, conducting thorough testing on multiple devices, implementing efficient code architecture, and monitoring app metrics post-launch. We also perform load testing and optimize images, network calls, and memory usage.

**Q: What about backend for mobile apps?**
A: We can develop complete solutions including mobile apps, backend APIs, and admin dashboards. We provide end-to-end development or integrate with existing backend systems.

A: Yes, we can build apps for both platforms using either native development (separate codebases) or cross-platform frameworks like React Native or Flutter (single codebase for both).

**Q: How long does mobile app development take?**
A: Timeline varies based on complexity. A simple MVP can take 2-3 months, while complex enterprise apps can take 6+ months. We provide detailed timelines during the planning phase.

**Q: What's the cost of mobile app development?**
A: Costs vary based on features, complexity, and platform. We provide detailed quotes after understanding your requirements. Generally, cross-platform apps are more cost-effective than native apps.
